# Merged Commentary
This mod for Half-Life 2 merges the Community Commentary from Half-Life 2: Update to the original game's 20th Anniversary Update's Developer Commentary mode so you can listen to both commentaries in-game.

Alongside Valve's latest 2024 Developer Commentary, the 2015 Community Commentary features voices from various YouTubers including Caddicarus, Brutalmoose, Ricepirate, Balrog the Master, ProJared, and Accursed Farms (Ross Scott from Freeman's Mind).

This mod also comes with minor enhancements to the commentaries including:
- Added titles of the discussed topic next to the speaker's name. (For example: "Gabe Newell - Intro of Developer Commentary")
- The speakers are labled with either [VALVE] or [COMMUNITY] if they're a developer or a fan.
- For subtitles, speakers are colour-coded instead. Valve members are red-coloured and community members are blue-coloured.
- Some proofreading for the subtitles and updated Caddicarus' first name.

This repository does not contain audio files but the release does.
